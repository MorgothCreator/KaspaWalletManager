<h1>KaspaWalletManager</h1>

<p>Currently the code is in development, most of the UI is done.</p>

<p>It supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create wallet.</li>
<li>Create accounts ( At this moment does not show the generated seed and verify it ).</li>
<li>Fetch balances of addresses.</li>
<li>Show seed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generated addresses are not real they are derived from the seed but not the correct ones.</h2>

<p>If in settings is TESTNET selected will connect to a localhost 127.0.0.1:16210 node, if MAINNET is selected will connect to 23.88.70.20:30110 node.</p>

<p>I managed to make gRPC work only on MacOs, there are included the Apple Silicon libs.</p>

<p>Anyway building for MacOs is good enough to advance the base code till Rusty with JSON API will be implemented.</p>

<p>The wallet is AES256 encrypted with a SHA256 of the password and contain no additional data beside the base58 encoded seed as JSON file.</p>

<p>There need more coding in Kaspa address generating, transaction picking/aggregating/signing.</p>

<p>My cryptography skills are limited to pretty much copy/paste and glue level especially when I talk about BIP32 stuff, if someone can take the work for that it will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>There I implemented some code taken from Bitcoin core code and try to adapt with no success.</p>

<p>I prefer in time to translate the BIP32 and all wallet core code from Qt to pure C++ code to be able to implement the wallet on IOT devices.</p>

<p>The mainwindow.cpp file has implemented some testing code for fast check of the correctitude of some functions in project.</p>

<p>The project uses Qt 6.2.4 lib version but work with newer version as well, I prefer older to be compatible with older OS'es.</p>

<p>The code is little bit messy, but I usually create readable code..., as usually when the wallet will be functional the "cleanItUp()" human function will be activated :)</p>
